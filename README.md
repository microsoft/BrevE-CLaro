# BrevE and CLaro

This is the repository for our paper "BrevE and CLaro: an evaluation of Spanish text simplification". 
- BrevE is a corpus designed for Spanish complex sentence identification (CSI).
- CLaro is a corpus for complex word identification (CWI).

Both corpora have been annotated by native Spanish speakers. This is important because:

- Spanish is a language spoken by almost half a billion people!
- Spanish morphology is quite different than English, and the sentence structure / word order allows for nuances that are not easily translated.

Text simplification (TS) is an important area of NLP, and is designed to make written material more accessible to a variety of users. 
However, it has been shown that identifying sentences that _need_ simplification on the first place considerably improves the performance of any TS system. 
Our work is meant to benchmark this.
